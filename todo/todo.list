Kernel compilations:
	1 - tinyconfig + printk + ... 	-> arm (gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf)
	2 - tinyconfig			-> arm (gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf)
	3 - tinyconfig			-> x86 (gcc)
	4 - tinyconfig - syscall(x)	-> x86 (gcc)
	5 - tinyconfig			-> arm (gcc + flags) (VOIDED)
	6 - tinyconfig + printk + ...	-> arm (gcc + flags) (VOIDED)
	7 - tinyconfig + pvh_header	-> x86 (gcc)

Kernel executable comparison:
	1 vs 2 - what have been introduced with Kconfig customization
	2 vs 3 - architecture dependent/independent syscalls
	4 - kernel testing
	2 vs 5 - toolchain comparison on minimal kernel (VOIDED)
	1 vs 6 - toolchain comparison on not minimal kernel (VOIDED)

Further kernel tinyfication:
	Kernel profiling under the x86 VM, track the unused kernel parts (likely
	syscalls). Remove those calls from the source/object tree during 
	compilation/linking.

Note:	kernel compilation #7: menuconfig modification
		
		Processor type and features ---> Linux guest support 
		--->Support for running as a PVH guest

			Qemu needs the PVH header to be able to load the kernel 
			into memory. The kernel did not crash.

		Printk support

		Initramfs

		Executable file format ---> Kernel support for ELF

			The kernel can't load from the initramfs a binary which
			was not compiled "with" the kernel

		Device Drivers ---> Character devices ---> Enable tty (true) 
		---> Serial drivers ---> 8250/16550 and compatible serial support (true) && Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port (true).

			Kernel need serial drivers to use a serial console
