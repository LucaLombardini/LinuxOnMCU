The microcontroller STM32F401RE does not embeds any Memory Management Unit.
The simplest thing to do is to disable the mmu support of the Linux kernel
during compile time, during which also the programs to run must be compiled.
This means that all the addresses are fixed and bounded to the physical ones.
No dynamic memory (probably), no memori paging and swapping are performed.
While swapping could be performed, this procedure wears out the flash write
cycles, thus reducing the product lifespan.
